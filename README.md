> :warning: **DISCLAIMER**: pufferfish is in *very* early stages of development. APIs can and will change, many basic features are missing, and parts of this README may not reflect the current state of the crate. I would recommend against using this in your projects just yet, but for those brave enough, now is the time for suggestions and feature requests!

### Features

- Minimal and opinionated API
- Simple but flexible callback system
- Easy input handling via polling
- Efficient 2D renderer with sprite batching, powered by [`fugu`](https://github.com/pufferfish-rs/fugu)
- Asset loader with support for custom formats

### Getting Started

To add pufferfish to your project, add the following to the dependencies section of your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
pufferfish = "0.1"
```

See the `examples/` directory in the source to get a feel of how pufferfish's API works.

A basic pufferfish program looks something like this:

```rust
use pufferfish::graphics::{Color, Graphics};
use pufferfish::App;

struct State {
    // Your game state...
}

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .with_title("Hello World")
        .add_state(State::new()) // Add your state
        .add_init_callback(init) // Add your callbacks
        .add_frame_callback(update)
        .add_frame_callback(draw)
        .run();
}

fn init(state: &mut State) {
    // Initialization code here...
}

fn update(state: &mut State) {
    // Update code here...
}

// Request arbitrary state through the callback's type signature
fn draw(state: &State, g: &Graphics) {
    g.clear(Color::from_rgb(0., 0., 0.));
    g.begin();
    // Draw code here...
    g.end();
}
```
